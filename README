1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a  distribution of libraries for R6RS Scheme
implementations; it provides  the INFIX macro which converts
the  traditional  infix  notation  for  expressions  to  the
equivalent Scheme's prefix notation.

  The library has no dependencies, the implementation itself
is a single, definitive, kill'em all DEFINE-SYNTAX form.

  The  library supports  Ikarus, Larceny,  Mosh,  Vicare and
Ypsilon, PLT Scheme; Petite Chez  should work but there is a
bug right now.

3. Testing
----------

The included Makefile provides  a "test" rule which attempts
to run tests with  all the supported Scheme implementations.
In detail the following rules are defined:

  itest - Run tests with Ikarus
  ltest - Run tests with Larceny
  mtest - Run tests with Mosh
  ptest - Run tests with Petite Chez
  vtest - Run tests with Vicare
  ytest - Run tests with Ypsilon
  ztest - Run tests with PLT Scheme


A. Credits
----------

The library is the work  of Marco Maggi, the code is derived
from the Nausicaa/Scheme distribution of libraries.

  The  parser  driver  is   from  the  Lalr-scm  package  by
Dominique Boucher, the parser  table is also generated using
Lalr-scm.
